 Navigation that sticks to top when reached with scroll then slides out to top after some more scrolling. Subtle indicators like cursor: context-menu and n-resize along with a minimal :before pseudo element are used to make the behavior perceptible. Great for one page sites.

Forked from [Marian Arlt](http://codepen.io/marianarlt/)'s Pen [Custom sticky navigation with slide out](http://codepen.io/marianarlt/pen/jEKzvX/).
